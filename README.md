# File Search Engine

This is a simple file search engine implemented in C++ that allows you to search for specific word in a collection of files. The program reads file names from the 'doclist.txt' file and stop words from the 'stoplist.txt' file. It then provides results based on the input word, indicating in which file(s) the word is located. Additionally, it maintains a search history.

## File Structure

The project has the following file structure:

search_engine.cpp: Contains the main source code of the search engine.

doclist.txt: A text file that contains the list of file names to be searched.

stoplist.txt: A text file that contains a list of stop words that are ignored during the search.

history.txt: A text file that maintains the search history.

Make sure the files you want to search is placed in the same directory as the program.
